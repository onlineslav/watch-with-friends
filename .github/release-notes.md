## What's new in 0.8.5

Windows users and Mac users on 0.5.3 or later receive this release through the in-app updater. Mac users on 0.5.2 or earlier should install the DMG below once to enable future in-app updates.

- **The controls hide again while something plays.** After clicking the timeline, the volume slider or a menu such as subtitles, the controls and top bar could stay on screen for the rest of the film. They now get out of the way after a few seconds, as they should.
- **Clicking outside Settings saves and closes it.** No more Save or Discard question when you click off the Settings panel, with either mouse button, and the click no longer reaches the movie behind it.

Also in 0.8.4: no freezes when the host's computer is busy, a sharp picture again after a bad patch, and the timeline shows where a click will jump to. See the 0.8.4 release for details.

## Download

Download the file for your computer from **Assets** below:

Not sure which Mac you have? Open the Apple menu, then **About This Mac**. "Chip: Apple M..." means Apple Silicon; "Processor: Intel" means Intel.

## First launch

- **Windows:** run the installer. If a blue SmartScreen box appears, click **More info**, then **Run anyway**.
- **Mac:** open the `.dmg` and drag the app into **Applications**. Then open **Terminal**, paste this line, and press Enter (only needed once):

  ```sh
  xattr -cr "/Applications/Watch With Friends.app"
  ```

## Watching together

1. Pick a username and display name the first time the app opens.
2. One person clicks **Create a room** and sends the code to the other, or invites them from the friends list.
3. The other person types the code and clicks **Join**.
4. Add local media or a YouTube link. Everyone can pause, seek, and pick their own subtitles for local media.
